# DLBCL_Tumor_Cell_States_scRNAseq
## Project Overview
This project aims to characterize the tumor cell states and ecosystems in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The analysis includes cell cycle scoring, clustering, differential expression analysis, and visualization of cell states.

## Data
The scRNA-seq data used in this project is derived from DLBCL tumor samples. The dataset includes raw sequencing reads, processed gene expression matrices, and metadata for each cell.

### Data Processing

### Analysis
Clustering and Identifying Cell States

### Visualisation

### Results
The analysis results include:
Identified cell clusters and their marker genes
Visulaising of cell states using techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP
Insights into the functional roles of different cell states within the tumor microenvironment
