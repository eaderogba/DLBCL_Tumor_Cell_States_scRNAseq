# DLBCL_Tumor_Cell_States_scRNAseq
## Project Overview
This project aims to characterize the tumor cell states and ecosystems in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The analysis includes cell cycle scoring, clustering, differential expression analysis, and visualization of cell states.
